    <h1>A Little History of the World Wide Web</h1>
   <p><i>See also <a href="https://www.w3.org/2004/Talks/w3c10-HowItAllStarted/">How It All Started</a> presentation materials from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2004/09/W3C10.html">W3C 10th Anniversary Celebration</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/History.html#refs">other references</a>.<br><br>

    from 1945 to 1995</i></p>
<h2>1945</h2>
<p>Vannevar Bush writes <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">an article</a> in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/world/"> Atlantic Monthly</a> about a photo-electrical-mechanical device called a Memex, for memory extension, which could make and follow links between documents on microfiche</p>
<h2>1960s</h2>
<p>Doug Engelbart prototypes an "oNLine System" (NLS) which does hypertext browsing editing, email, and so on. He invents the mouse for this purpose. See the<a href="ootstrap.org/library.htm"> Bootstrap Institute library</a>.<br><br>

    Ted Nelson coins the word Hypertext in A File Structure for the Complex, the Changing, and the Indeterminate. 20th National Conference, New York, <a href="https://www.acm.org/"></a>, 1965. See also: Literary Machines. Note: There used to be a link here to "Hypertext and Hypermedia: A Selected Bibliography" by Terence Harpold, but the site hosting the resource did not maintain the link.<br><br>
    
    Andy van Dam and others build the Hypertext Editing System and FRESS in 1967.</p>
    <h2>1980</h2>
    <p>While consulting for CERN June-December of 1980, Tim Berners-Lee writes a notebook program, "Enquire-Within-Upon-Everything", which allows links to be made between arbitrary nodes. Each node had a title, a type, and a list of bidirectional typed links. "ENQUIRE" ran on Norsk Data machines under SINTRAN-III. See: <a href="https://www.w3.org/History/1980/Enquire/scaled/">Enquire user manual as scanned images</a> or as<a href="https://www.w3.org/History/1980/Enquire/manual/"> HTML page(alt)</a>.</p>

        <dt>September</dt>
        <dd>Mike Sendall, Tim's boss, Oks the purchase of a NeXT cube, and allows Tim to go ahead and write a global hypertext system.</dd>
        <dt>October</dt>
        <dd>Tim starts work on a hypertext GUI browser+editor using the NeXTStep development environment. He makes up "WorldWideWeb" as a name for the program. (See the first browser screenshot) "World Wide Web" as a name for the project (over Information Mesh, Mine of Information, and Information Mine).
            Project original proposal reformulated with encouragement from CN and ECP divisional management. Robert Cailliau (ECP) joins and is co-author of new version.</dd>
            <dt>November</dt>
            <dd>Initial WorldWideWeb program development continues on the NeXT (TBL) . This was a "what you see is what you get" (wysiwyg) browser/editor with direct inline creation of links. The first web server was nxoc01.cern.ch, later called info.cern.ch, and the first web page http://nxoc01.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html Unfortunately CERN no longer supports the historical site. Note from this era too, the least recently modified web page we know of, last changed Tue, 13 Nov 1990 15:17:00 GMT (though the URI changed.)</dd>
            <dt>November</dt>
            <dd>Technical Student Nicola Pellow (CN) joins and starts work on the line-mode browser. Bernd Pollermann (CN) helps get interface to CERNVM "FIND" index running. TBL gives a colloquium on hypertext in general.</dd>
            <dt>Christmas</dt>
            <dd>Line mode browser and WorldWideWeb browser/editor demonstrable. Acces is possible to hypertext files, CERNVM "FIND", and Internet news articles.
